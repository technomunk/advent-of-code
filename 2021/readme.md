# Solutions for the year 2021

Done using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) starting with 0 experience in the language. Main goal was to learn a new language and have fun. Solutions are reasonably straight forward, made to be easy to follow along with advent of code instructions.

## Installation

Follow official [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) instructions. @technomunk tested solutions using [Ruby 3.0.3-1](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/3.0/ruby-3.0.3.tar.gz).

## Running

### Days 1-5:

1. Get the input for a particular day from [advent of code page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).
2. Paste the input into a file named the number of the day (0-padded) .txt, ex: `01.txt`.
3. Run the ruby file for that particular day: `ruby 01_sonar_sweep.rb`

### Days 6-22, 24-25:

1. Get the input for a particular day from [advent of code page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).
2. Run the ruby script for that particular day, piping the input into standard input: `ruby 06_lanternfish.rb < [input_file]`.

## Day 23

Day 23 was solved manually with a pen and paper. A programmatic solution would be just an exhaustive search of all possible plays at any given point.
